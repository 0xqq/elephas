Schematically, elephas works as follows.\r\n\r\n![Elephas](elephas.gif)\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nElephas brings deep learning with [Keras](http://keras.io) to [Spark](http://spark.apache.org). Elephas intends to keep the simplicity and high usability of Keras, thereby allowing for fast prototyping of distributed models, which can be run on massive data sets.\r\n\r\nἐλέφας is Greek for _ivory_ and an accompanying project to κέρας, meaning _horn_. If this seems weird mentioning, like a bad dream, you should confirm it actually is at the [Keras documentation](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/README.md). Elephas also means _elephant_, as in stuffed yellow elephant.\r\n\r\nElephas implements a class of data-parallel algorithms on top of Keras, using Spark's RDDs and data frames. Keras Models are initialized on the driver, then serialized and shipped to workers, alongside with data and broadcasted model parameters. Spark workers deserialize the model, train their chunk of data and send their gradients back to the driver. The \"master\" model on the driver is updated by an optimizer, which takes gradients either synchronously or asynchronously.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nInstall elephas from PyPI with \r\n```\r\npip install elephas\r\n```\r\nA quick way to install Spark locally is to use homebrew on Mac like this\r\n```\r\nbrew install spark\r\n```\r\nor linuxbrew on linux.\r\n```\r\nbrew install apache-spark\r\n```\r\nThe brew version of Spark is outdated, so we recommend installing Spark as follows:\r\n```\r\nwget http://apache.mirrors.tds.net/spark/spark-1.5.2/spark-1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz\r\n1.5.2-bin-hadoop2.6.tgz -P ~\r\nsudo tar zxvf ~/spark-* -C /usr/local\r\nsudo mv /usr/local/spark-* /usr/local/spark \r\n```\r\nAfter that, make sure to put these path variables to your shell profile (e.g. `~/.zshrc`):\r\n```\r\nexport SPARK_HOME=/usr/local/spark\r\nexport PATH=$PATH:$SPARK_HOME/bin\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is not an option, you should simply follow the instructions at the [Spark download section](http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html).  \r\n\r\n### Basic example\r\nAfter installing both Elephas and Spark, training a model is done schematically as follows:\r\n\r\n- Create a local pyspark context\r\n```python\r\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf\r\nconf = SparkConf().setAppName('Elephas_App').setMaster('local[8]')\r\nsc = SparkContext(conf=conf)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Define and compile a Keras model\r\n```python\r\nmodel = Sequential()\r\nmodel.add(Dense(128, input_dim=784))\r\nmodel.add(Activation('relu'))\r\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.2))\r\nmodel.add(Dense(128))\r\nmodel.add(Activation('relu'))\r\nmodel.add(Dropout(0.2))\r\nmodel.add(Dense(10))\r\nmodel.add(Activation('softmax'))\r\nmodel.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer=SGD())\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Create an RDD from numpy arrays \r\n```python\r\nfrom elephas.utils.rdd_utils import to_simple_rdd\r\nrdd = to_simple_rdd(sc, X_train, Y_train)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- A SparkModel is defined by passing Spark context and Keras model. Additionally, one has choose an optimizer used for updating the elephas model, an update frequency, a parallelization mode and the degree of parallelism, i.e. the number of workers.\r\n```python\r\nfrom elephas.spark_model import SparkModel\r\nfrom elephas import optimizers as elephas_optimizers\r\n\r\nadagrad = elephas_optimizers.Adagrad()\r\nspark_model = SparkModel(sc,model, optimizer=adagrad, frequency='epoch', mode='asynchronous', num_workers=2)\r\nspark_model.train(rdd, nb_epoch=20, batch_size=32, verbose=0, validation_split=0.1, num_workers=8)\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Run your script using spark-submit\r\n```\r\nspark-submit --driver-memory 1G ./your_script.py\r\n```\r\nIncreasing the driver memory even further may be necessary, as the set of parameters in a network may be very large and collecting them on the driver eats up a lot of resources. See the examples folder for a few working examples.\r\n\r\n### Spark MLlib example\r\nFollowing up on the last example, to create an RDD of LabeledPoints for supervised training from pairs of numpy arrays, use \r\n```python\r\nfrom elephas.utils.rdd_utils import to_labeled_point\r\nlp_rdd = to_labeled_point(sc, X_train, Y_train, categorical=True)\r\n```\r\nTraining a given LabeledPoint-RDD is very similar to what we've seen already\r\n```python\r\nfrom elephas.spark_model import SparkMLlibModel\r\nadadelta = elephas_optimizers.Adadelta()\r\nspark_model = SparkMLlibModel(sc,model, optimizer=adadelta, frequency='batch', mode='hogwild', num_workers=2)\r\nspark_model.train(lp_rdd, nb_epoch=20, batch_size=32, verbose=0, validation_split=0.1, categorical=True, nb_classes=nb_classes)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Spark ML example\r\nTo train a model with a SparkML estimator on a data frame, use the following syntax.\r\n```python\r\ndf = to_data_frame(sc, X_train, Y_train, categorical=True)\r\ntest_df = to_data_frame(sc, X_test, Y_test, categorical=True)\r\n\r\nadadelta = elephas_optimizers.Adadelta()\r\nestimator = ElephasEstimator(sc,model, \r\n        nb_epoch=nb_epoch, batch_size=batch_size, optimizer=adadelta, frequency='batch', mode='asynchronous', num_workers=2,\r\n        verbose=0, validation_split=0.1, categorical=True, nb_classes=nb_classes)\r\n\r\nfitted_model = estimator.fit(df)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFitting an estimator results in a SparkML transformer, which we can use for predictions and other evaluations by calling the transform method on it.\r\n\r\n``` python\r\nprediction = fitted_model.transform(test_df)\r\npnl = prediction.select(\"label\", \"prediction\")\r\npnl.show(100)\r\n\r\nprediction_and_label= pnl.map(lambda row: (row.label, row.prediction))\r\nmetrics = MulticlassMetrics(prediction_and_label)\r\nprint(metrics.precision())\r\nprint(metrics.recall())\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nIn the first example above we have seen that an elephas model is instantiated like this\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspark_model = SparkModel(sc,model, optimizer=adagrad, frequency='epoch', mode='asynchronous', num_workers=2)\r\n```\r\nSo, apart from the canonical Spark context and Keras model, Elephas models have four parameters to tune and we will describe each of them next.\r\n\r\n### Model updates (optimizers)\r\n\r\n`optimizer`: The optimizers module in elephas is an adaption of the same module in keras, i.e. it provides the user with the following list of optimizers:\r\n\r\n- `SGD`\r\n- `RMSprop`\r\n- `Adagrad`\r\n- `Adadelta`\r\n- `Adam`\r\n\r\nOnce constructed, each of these can be passed to the *optimizer* parameter of the model. Updates in keras are computed with the help of theano, so most of the data structures in keras optimizers stem from theano. In elephas, gradients have already been computed by the respective workers, so it makes sense to entirely work with numpy arrays internally. \r\n\r\nNote that in order to set up an elephas model, you have to specify two optimizers, one for elephas and one for the underlying keras model. Individual workers produce updates according to keras optimizers and the \"master\" model on the driver uses elephas optimizers to aggregate them. For starters, we recommend keras models with SGD and elephas models with Adagrad or Adadelta.\r\n\r\n### Update frequency\r\n\r\n`frequency`: The user can decide how often updates are passed to the master model by controlling the *frequency* parameter. To update every batch, choose 'batch' and to update only after every epoch, choose 'epoch'.\r\n\r\n### Update mode\r\n\r\n`mode`: Currently, there's three different modes available in elephas, each corresponding to a different heuristic or parallelization scheme adopted, which is controlled by the *mode* parameter. The default property is 'asynchronous'.\r\n\r\n#### Asynchronous updates with read and write locks (`mode='asynchronous'`)\r\n\r\nThis mode implements the algorithm described as *downpour* in [1], i.e. each worker can send updates whenever they are ready. The master model makes sure that no update gets lost, i.e. multiple updates get applied at the \"same\" time,  by locking the master parameters while reading and writing parameters. This idea has been used in Google's DistBelief framework. \r\n\r\n#### Asynchronous updates without locks (`mode='hogwild'`)\r\nEssentially the same procedure as above, but without requiring the locks. This heuristic assumes that we still fare well enough, even if we loose an update here or there. Updating parameters lock-free in a non-distributed setting for SGD goes by the name 'Hogwild!' [2], it's distributed extension is called 'Dogwild!' [3].  \r\n\r\n#### Synchronous updates (`mode='synchronous'`)\r\n\r\nIn this mode each worker sends a new batch of parameter updates at the same time, which are then processed on the master. Accordingly, this algorithm is sometimes called *batch synchronous parallel* or just BSP.\r\n\r\n### Degree of parallelization (number of workers)\r\n\r\n`num_workers`: Lastly, the degree to which we parallelize our training data is controlled by the parameter *num_workers*.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPremature parallelization may not be the root of all evil, but it may not always be the best idea to do so. Keep in mind that more workers mean less data per worker and parallelizing a model is not an excuse for actual learning. So, if you can perfectly well fit your data into memory *and* you're happy with training speed of the model consider just using keras. \r\n\r\nOne exception to this rule may be that you're already working within the Spark ecosystem and want to leverage what's there. The above SparkML example shows how to use evaluation modules from Spark and maybe you wish to further process the outcome of an elephas model down the road. In this case, we recommend to use elephas as a simple wrapper by setting num_workers=1.\r\n\r\nNote that right now elephas restricts itself to data-parallel algorithms for two reasons. First, Spark simply makes it very easy to distribute data. Second, neither Spark nor Theano make it particularly easy to split up the actual model in parts, thus making model-parallelism practically impossible to realize.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, we hope you learn to appreciate elephas as a pretty easy to setup and use playground for data-parallel deep-learning algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Future work & contributions\r\n\r\nConstructive feedback and pull requests for elephas are very welcome. Here's a few things we're having in mind for future development \r\n\r\n- Tighter Spark ML integration. Pipelines do not work yet.\r\n- Benchmarks for training speed and accuracy.\r\n- Some real-world tests on EC2 instances with large data sets like imagenet.\r\n\r\n## Literature\r\n[1] J. Dean, G.S.
